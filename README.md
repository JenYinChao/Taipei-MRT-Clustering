# Taipei-MRT-Clustering
Data Science with Python Final Project

# Introduction
Taipei MRT, i.e. mass repaid transit, is the biggest metro service system in Taiwan. There are five main line with 108 stops and the cumulative rider-ship has been more than 10 billion until now, Apr 2019, while several lines are still under construction.

People take MRT with various purpose, includes going to work, school, traveling, so on and so forth, so some stops are crowed all the times, like Taipei Main Station, which is the biggest transit stop in Taipei, while some may be busy only at some specific time period, like Taipei Zoo which might be busy in the weekend and Software Park which might be busy only during the weekdays. Accordingly, the pattern of each stopâ€™s weekly rider-ship might be different, and theoretically I can separate them into different groups relying on it, which is also the goal that I want to know in this project.
